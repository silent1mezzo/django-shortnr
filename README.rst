====================
Django Shortnr
====================
The Django Shortnr app came about because I had a free night while my finance was making a Halloween costume.  I realize there are many apps like this available but it was more to see how quickly I could do it.

Here's a list of features
#. Shortens any url
#. Keeps tracks of the shortened url usage

Upcomming Features
#. Ability to store urls if your logged in

Again, this has been done, and probably been done better elsewhere. I was just bored...

Installation
============

#. Add the following to your `INSTALLED_APPS`
	``'shortnr'``

#. Create the variable `SHORTEN_LINK_URL`
	``SHORTEN_LINK_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/view/'``
